# WAVE v1.1.1 - *We got a timer now bois!*

**Basically a Noisli Clone  
Author: Elvis Bui**  

My girlfriend was a bit tired of Noisli's wall-gated features and I wanted to create a project and practice my 
basic web-development skills. As a result, WAVE was born.

Sounds gathered from freesounds.org  
Icons gathered from flaticon.org
